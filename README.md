# Joes Swap v2
Upgraded version of Joes Swap v1.

## What got introduced in v2
1. Real ERC20 tokens as pairs
2. Swap the other way around
3. Fix the slippage - good samaritan
4. Add possibility to set maxAmount of token1 for amount of token0 and vice versa
5. Hand out LP tokens to liquidity providers - as fees

This is a very basic implementation of a Decentralized Exchange using Solidity and Foundry.

## Where this can be improved
1. Add real ERC20 tokens as pairs
2. Add swap the other way around
3. Make the sqrt function more accurate
4. Hand out LP tokens to liquidity providers
5. Fix the slippage
6. Add possibility to set maxAmount of token1 for amount of token0
7. Add events and errors
